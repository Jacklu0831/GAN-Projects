Some projects I did while learning about generative adversarial networks from online lectures of Ian Goodfellow (DCGAN) and Jun Yan Zhu (CycleGAN). Also wrote more detailed explanation of project 3 and 4 in their folders. I find the concept of having advarsarial networks competing to minimize their individual losses with the expense of the other to be incredibly innovative. Also, using the concept of Cycle-Consistency-Loss to incorporate an element of supervised learning for producing images out of thin air is interesting and fun to implement as well. I will continue looking into GAN and find out just [how dangerous it becomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake).
